        <h2>Training Approach</h2>
        <h3>Barb's Training Statement</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I work individually with each horse and rider combination to help them
          understand each other better. My desire is to teach people how to
          build a relationship with their horse where they learn from each other
          and grow together. It is possible to communicate and succesfully train
          the horse in a way they understand; without fear or intimidation but
          instead through a common sense, patient, and consistent program.
        </p>
        <p>
          We build a trusting relationship where your horse learns to look to
          you for guidanace; it is from there he will really "learn" what we
          want and not just be "reacting" to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then incorporate the basic handling program adopted from Pat Wyse.
          This is the essential training foundation that we build on to train
          our horse to be willing partners for any type of riding we desire. It
          is a perfect program for creating an all-around horse capable of
          competing in multiple disciplines succesfully. Our horses learn to be
          quiet, dependable, and capable in any situation. We can trust our
          horse will always listen to us fully and perform to his or her best
          ability.
        </p>
